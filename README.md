# Dockerfiles
> Personal Dockerfiles

This repository contains Dockerfiles for images I use daily or every once in a
while so I can experiment/use binaries/programs without having to install the
dependencies. Most of my time is spent developing in a container with vim and
other dependencies required by the project or application.
